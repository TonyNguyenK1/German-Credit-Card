# German Credit Card Analysis Project

## 📋 Overview

This project involves analyzing German credit card data to explore trends, patterns, and factors affecting creditworthiness. The dataset includes features such as credit history, account balance, loan purpose, and more, making it a valuable resource for financial risk analysis and predictive modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the factors that contribute to a good or bad credit score.
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Develop machine learning models to predict creditworthiness.
- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 📈 Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset is a public dataset containing information on German credit card holders.
- **Size**: Contains 1000 rows and 21 columns.
- **Features**:
  - Age
  - Credit Amount
  - Duration
  - Credit History
  - Employment Status
  - Loan Purpose
  - ... and more!

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Perform data cleaning and encoding for categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize trends and distributions.
   - Identify correlations among variables.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare model results to determine the best-performing model.
